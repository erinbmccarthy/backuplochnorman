      <br />
      <img border="0" src="images/scooter2.jpg" width="321" height="222" align="right" hspace="5" />A long time guitar player, 1968 marked a big change 
      in the music Scooter Muse had digested during the 
      folk years. Bonnie and Clyde had a banjo on the 
      soundtrack &#8211; Earl Scruggs&#8217; Foggy Mt. Breakdown &#8211; and 
      from that point on he never looked back.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, after the summer of 1972, with the sound of 
      Dueling Banjos on any folkie&#8217;s mind, Scooter 
      purchased his first banjo, took a few lessons &#8211; and 
      almost 40 years later has been fortunate to win 
      countless banjo competitions throughout the 
      southeast including the Tennessee Valley 
      Championships 8 times.<br />
      <br />
      He has played banjo with bluegrass legends, Claire 
      Lynch, Vassar Clements and a host of others as well 
      as handling first call banjo duties for the world 
      famous Muscle Shoals, Alabama recording industry.<br />
      <br />
      While at the Briarfield Bluegrass Festival in 
      Alabama in the early 80&#8217;s, another life-changer for 
      him was experiencing the progressive Celtic sounds 
      of a great band, Touchstone.&nbsp;That show launched him 
      into the world of Celtic music on banjo, and 
      ultimately, moving into the world of open tunings on 
      the guitar.<br />
      In the 90&#8217;s he founded the Full Moon Ensemble, who 
      achieved national recognition, toured the US and 
      Canada as well as Scotland and recorded 5 critically 
      acclaimed CDs. After a successful 8 year run, the 
      FME went their separate ways and Scooter was drafted 
      as the guitar player for the longest running Celtic 
      band in the south, Henri&#8217;s Notions, based in 
      Tuscaloosa, AL for over 30 years.&nbsp;The Notions 
      consistently play festivals, concerts and other 
      venues throughout the southeast and have appeared 
      with such great artists as Bob Dylan, Paddy Obrien, 
      Patrick Street, Brian McNeill and countless others.<br />
      <br />
      In 2005, Scooter recorded his first solo guitar CD, 
      Saddell Abbey, with all original material as well as 
      original music set to the poetry of Robert Burns.</p>
