    <p><strong class="redText">The Kilt Dedication</strong><br />
      The  Kilt Dedication is sponsored by Clan Henderson. It will occur immediately  following Opening Ceremonies on Saturday. Each person (Novice) who has received  his or her first kilt (rentals or loaners don't count) in the year since the  last Loch Norman Highland Games will be called to line up in front of the Clan  Henderson tent. Each Novice should arrange to have a kinsman as a Tartan Banner  Bearer to follow him and to witness the ceremony. The Master of Ceremonies will  present a wee sma' dedication glass to each Novice. The Aides-de-camp will pour  Scottish spring water or uisge beatha 'round. The Aides-de camp will then dip a  corner of the Novice's new kilt into the dedication glass. Following a few cogent  remarks, the assembly encourages you to join them in toasting the tartan and  the kilts as the Novices &amp; their Tartan Banner Bearers march one time  around the field.</p>
    <p><strong class="redText">Flag Retirement Ceremony</strong><br />
      A  set of rules for civilian flag courtesy popularly known as The Flag Code was  first formulated by the National Flag Conference in 1923. On December 22, 1942,  Congress enacted most of the provisions of The Flag Code into law. Scottish American  Military Society (SAMS) Post 1775 will conduct a Flag Retirement Ceremony on  the main field on Saturday. You may bring your ragged and torn National flags  to be retired with dignity. SAMS accepts flags year round for the following year’s  Ceremony, or they may be brought to Historic Rural Hill throughout the year as  well.    </p>
    <p><strong class="redText">Flowers of the Forest  Ceremony</strong><br />
      At  the instigation of the ambitious younger brothers of the King of the Scots,  Henry<strong> </strong>VIII led an army against Scotland. King James IV and the  &quot;flowers&quot; of Scottish nobility<strong> </strong>were brutally slain at the  Battle of Flodden on September 9, 1513, one of the greatest<strong> </strong>disasters to  befall the country.<strong> </strong>The pipe tune &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; was  a soulful lament written shortly after the<strong> </strong>battle. The  &quot;forest&quot; refers to a district of Scotland called Ettrick Forest<strong> </strong>where  the battle took place. Although much of the original lament<strong> </strong>has been  lost, Mrs. Patrick Cockburn, who lived from 1712-1792, is<strong> </strong>credited with  this version.<strong> “</strong><em>The sorrow felt for lost loved ones reaches across the  centuries<strong> </strong>as we remember members of our family who have gone before us.”</em><strong></strong><br />
      The Flowers  of the Forest Ceremony takes place at the Rural Hill Cairn alongside the new  Cultural Center. The sign, which remains posted throughout the year, reads:<br />
  <em>“The cairn is a memorial  built, stone by stone, by those who pass by. These stones have been placed here  in loving memory of our absent brothers and sisters who have passed on. They  are now Flowers of the Forest. Historic Rural Hill maintains a registry for the  Memorial Cairn.”</em></p>
    <p><strong class="redText">Border Collie Sheepherding  Demonstrations</strong><br />
      Sheepherding  demonstrations will occur both Saturday and Sunday on the main field and are  led by Dr. Ben Ousley, D.V.M. For further insight into the work of the dog and  handler, please read the following passage by Dr. Ben;</p>
    <p>It has been said  that no other breed has the livestock working instinct, the intelligence, and  the desire to please their master that Border Collies possess. Most Border  Collie owners would give no argument to that statement and several of them  would admit that they had tried other breeds first. </p>
    <p>These dogs have  been selected through the years for their ease in training and “eye”. This  quality has been described as the “hypnotic eye”, a concentration and alertness  that makes them appear much quicker than the sheep.</p>
    <p>The shepherd will  use voice commands such as stand, way to me (go right), come by (go left), lay  down and that'll do to work the dogs but at a distance these commands are translated  into whistles.</p>
    <p>Color and  conformation (size, height &amp; weight) are not important to the  qualifications of a good working collie dog. They are generally black with  white markings (some say it's good luck to have a small bit of brown). They  weigh 30 - 50 pounds and stand about 18 inches at the shoulder. Their fore legs  are often shorter than their hind legs. Watch the dogs work today. Border  collies love to work... and work... and work... and work. Ask questions.</p>
    <p>Do you have a need  for a dog with top stock handling skills back at your farm? Every farm has one  or more dogs that are being fed; doesn't it make sense to keep a breed that  will earn its keep? I hope this information will help you to better understand  and enjoy watching the sheep dogs work.</p>

    <p><strong class="redText">Celtic Music </strong>is one of the most  identifiable and recognized aspects of Scottish heritage and culture. Even to  the casual listener, Scottish music is easily recognized for its unique quality  and style. It has a definite power and presence that demands attention. This is  not music that can be ignored as &quot;background&quot; music. People find that  they are either magnetically drawn to it or beat a hasty retreat away from it.  This is Gaelic &quot;soul&quot; played with intense feeling and listened to as  an emotional experience.</p>
    <p>Scotland  and the other Celtic countries have produced an amazing amount of folk music  over the past 500 years. The distinctive sound of this music underlines the  cultural heritage shared by Scotland, Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Galicia  in Spain and the Brittany coast of France. Many tunes known for hundreds of  years throughout these regions are distinguished only by different names, words  and variations in performing styles. Within each region there are also tunes  that are unique to that area alone.</p>
    <p>Celtic  folk music is an ethnic musical form that continues to have contemporary music  written in the same style and feel as it was centuries ago.</p>
    <p><strong class="redText">The Saturday Night Celtic  Concert!</strong><br />
      Music  starts at 6:30 PM in the Celtic Rock Tent and is included in the price of your  Saturday admission ticket. All musical guests of the festival will be on hand  to perform and entertain! Invite your friends who didn't come out to join you  for the show - tickets at the door will be $10 for those not attending during  the day.        </p>
