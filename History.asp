    <h1><b></b>The History of Scottish Games</h1>
    <p>Modern Scottish Festivals have their roots in the middle  ages. We have reports of athletic competition (“Games”) at many times and  places when people gathered together; fairs, military musters (“wapenschaws”),  even funerals! Games which now feature track and field events, music, and dance  have been held in the village of Ceres (in Fife) since shortly after the battle  of Bannockburn in 1314. </p>
    <p> Scottish Games as we know them today began to develop in  1781 when the Highland Society of Falkirk sponsored prize money and trophies for  competitions in dancing, piping, and athletics during the town’s Fall Fair. In  1818 a Games was presented in St. Fillan’s with piping, athletics, and dancing  (including the Sword Dance for the first time). Within a few years Gatherings  were being held at many towns throughout Scotland. Many of these Gatherings are  still being held today.</p>
    <p> The increasing popularity of these events eventually led to  attempts to standardize the rules of competition and judging. Sanctioning bodies  were formed to develop uniform rules and maintain records, Highland dancing, piping,  and drumming teachers and judges stand for regular examinations to maintain their  certification. With renewed interest in Scottish harp and fiddle their  sanctioning organizations are seeing new growth.</p>
    <p> As Scots immigrated  to far-flung lands they took their sport and culture with them. Tradition tells  us that Games were held near Ellerbe, North Carolina in the late 1700s; most  sources state that the first Games in the U.S. were presented by Scottish  emigrants living in Boston in 1853. One source does state that the Boston Scots  had been meeting for “traditional games” for several years before that. There  is also a description of the “First Sportive Meet” of the Highland Society of  New York in the <em>Emigrant and</em> <em>Old Countryman</em> of October 19, 1836 which  gives some indication that regular competition took place during the first half  of the 19th Century.</p>
    <p> By 1861 at least three other Caledonian Clubs had joined  Boston – New York, Philadelphia, and Newark, New Jersey. The Civil War delayed  the spread of these events, but by 1875 Highland Games were being held in at  least 125 communities across America. These “Caledonian Games” generally  included competitions in dancing, music, and athletics; the athletics could include  foot races, hurdle races, wrestling, pole-vaulting, high and long jump, hop,  skip and jump, putting the heavy stone, throwing the hammer and the light and  heavy weights and turning the caber. </p>
    <p> With the rise in intercollegiate athletics in the late  1800's participation at Scottish Games went into a decline. Many events folded;  the ones that survived refocused on their cultural heritage and expanded to become  Festivals. Games and Festivals offer competition focused on traditional  Scottish athletic events, dance and music; they have expanded to include “fun”  competitions, non-competitive tests of skill and strength, and historical  re-enactments. </p>
    <p> The Scottish Games in the United States have grown because  many people of Scottish descent still feel the pull of their ancestral homeland  and heritage. The Games provide a connection to that heritage. For many, going  to the Games is like going home to a family reunion.</p>
