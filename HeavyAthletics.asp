    <p>Come see many world ranked professional heavy athletes including Eric Frasure,   who in 2010 set a world record at Rural Hill after throwing a 20 lb sheaf 36&rsquo;1!
      <!--#include file="FeaturedSponsors.asp" -->
    </p>
    <h3><b></b>There  are seven traditional Scottish heavy events. </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> The clachneart (stone of strength) - A stone weighing between 16 and 20 pounds  is thrown for distance. The maximum run up is 7-6”. At Rural Hill, the stone  used weighs 18 pounds for professionals and 17 pounds for amateurs.</li>
      <li>  The 16-pound or 22-pound hammer throw - The hammer is 50” long with a metal  head and flexible shaft. The competitor must throw over his shoulder with his  back to the trig; moving the feet is not allowed.</li>
      <li> The 28-pound and 56-pound weight throws for distance - These weights are metal  with a ring and chain attached. The overall length is 18”. The weights must be  thrown from behind the trig with a 9’-0” run up allowed. The competitor must be  standing when he completes his throw or a foul is called. For all of the above  events, each competitor is allowed three attempts with longest throw being recorded.  A foul is called if any part of the competitor’s body touches outside the  throwing area.</li>
      <li>The 56-pound weight throw for height - The object is to throw the weight  one-handed up and over a bar.</li>
      <li>The Sheaf Toss - The object is to throw a 20-pound burlap sack of straw over  the bar using a pitch fork.<br />
        For  each of these events the starting height is the height requested by the  competitors. The bar will be raised as long as at least one competitor clears  the bar and wants to continue. Competitors are allowed three tries at each  height.</li>
      <li>Turning the Caber - The caber is an 18- to 20-foot long section of tree trunk  with a noticeable taper at one end. The pole weighs between 115 and 140 pounds.  The competitor holds the small end and balances the pole in the air vertically.  He then runs forward and allows the high end to fall forward. At the right  moment he flips the small end up. If he has gotten it right the pole will  continue in motion after the large end hits the ground, turning over so that the  small end is pointed directly away from the contestant (12 o’clock, imagining  him to be at 6 o’clock). Each competitor gets three tries with the best result  being recorded. If no-one makes a perfect toss, closest to 12 o’clock wins.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><strong>Interested in competing in Amateur Scottish  heavy athletics?</strong><br />
      Please report to the heavy athletics tent to  register as early as 8:00am on Sunday Morning to register.</p>
<p><strong>Rules to Highland Wrestling  (Cumberland Style)</strong></p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>On taking hold the wrestlers stand  up chest to chest, each placing his chin on his opponent's right shoulder and  grasping him round the body and placing his right arm above the left arm of his  opponent. A wrestler refusing to take hold will be disqualified. When both men  have got hold and are fairly on their guard, the Referee shall call  &quot;hold&quot; and the wrestlers will commence, and, with the exception of  kicking, the wrestlers are allowed to use every legitimate means to throw each  other; to strike with the side of the foot shall not be regarded as kicking. If  either party breaks his hold, that is loses his grip, though not on the ground,  and the other still retains his hold, the one breaking shall be declared the  loser.<br />
        </li>
      <li>If either man touches the ground with  one knee only or any other part of his body, though he may still retain his hold,  he shall not be allowed to recover himself, but shall be deemed the loser. If  both fall to the ground the man who is first down or falls under the other  shall be the loser, but if they fall side by side or otherwise so that the  officials cannot decide which was first on the ground, it shall be termed a dog  fall, and shall be wrestled over again.</li>
      <li>The wrestlers shall compete in their  bare feet and shall be bare chested. The wearing of sweaters or pullovers is  forbidden. The Referee shall disqualify any wrestler using unfair means after  having been once cautioned.</li>
      <li>A fall is defined as touching the  ground with any part of the person, the feet excepted. All competitions shall  be decided by the best of three falls.</li>
      <li>All byes must be drawn in the first  round in all competitions. No byes are allowed after the first round.<br />
        </li>
      <li>The various styles of dress for the  North Country traditions of wrestling are varied, going from swim trunks over  thermal underwear (helpful in some of the Scottish high country) to garish and  colorful Elizabethan dress. The Rural Hill Scottish Festival requires  competitors to be kilted.</li>
