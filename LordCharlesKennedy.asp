    <h1><b></b>Archibald Angus Charles Kennedy The 8th Marquess of Ailsa Dead at Age 58</h1>
    <p><em>Lord Charles Kennedy was a friend  of the Rural Hill Scottish Festival and Loch Norman Highland Games. He was due  to return to the games this year. He will be sadly missed.</em></p>
    <p>Lord Charles Kennedy died  suddenly on Thursday, January 15, 2015 while in Altamonte Springs, Florida for  the Central Florida Scottish Games. He was to attend a small gathering of  fellow Clan Kennedy members at the host hotel when he suffered a fatal massive  aortic coronary. Memorial services for the hereditary chief were conducted by the  Titusville Fire Department Honor Guard and attended by members of the Kennedy  Society of North America, other clans and friends. Lady Rosemary Kennedy and  Lady Alicia Kennedy are transporting Lord Charles home to Scotland. Funeral  Services will be held January 29 at Kirkmichael Church in Ayrshire with a  private family burial service to follow.</p>
    <p>Lord Charles had planned to  attend the Loch Norman Highland Games at Rural Hill in Huntersville, NC; the  Virginia Highland Games, and the Longs Peak Scottish and Irish Festival in  Estes Park, Colorado as was his customary support of Kennedys in America.<br />
      He will be sadly missed by those  who knew and loved him.</p>
    <p>The 8th Marquess of Ailsa, 19th  Earl of Cassillis,&nbsp;21st&nbsp;Lord Kennedy and 8th&nbsp;Baron  Ailsa was born&nbsp;in 1956 at Culzean Castle in Ayrshire. At age two the  family moved to the former Kennedy seat, the 13th century Cassillis Castle near  Maybole, where he grew up. He took his seat in the House of Lords in June 1994,  following the death of his father in April of that year,&nbsp;succeeding his  father as Chief, Marquess and Earl.</p>
    <p>Lord Ailsa was educated in  Scotland at the Strathallan School in Perthshire and later studied forestry and  farming in Scotland and England and earned his degree - HND (Higher  National&nbsp;Diploma). He was the&nbsp;father of two delightful daughters,  Lady Rosemary and Lady Alicia, and the proud grandfather of two handsome  grandsons.</p>
    <p>In his late teens, when embarking  on his Forestry training in Morayshire, northeast Scotland, Lord Ailsa joined  The Queen&rsquo;s Own Highlanders Territorial Army Regiment. He was attached to the  82nd Army Youth Team, teaching skiing, mountaineering &amp; rappelling in the Cairngorms to young soldiers  and other Territorial Army regiments. After receiving his degree, his first job  was in South Wales where he was assigned to the 93rd Army Youth Team based at  the foot of the Breacon Beacons mountain range. Whilst in Wales he voluntarily  completed seven parachute jumps. Lord Ailsa  ended his Territorial Army days with The  Ayrshire Yoemanry in his home town of Ayr. The squadron was started by one of  his ancestors over 150 years ago.</p>
    <p>The Marquess of Ailsa was  occupied in sales and marketing for&nbsp;agricultural&nbsp;companies in  the&nbsp;UK and Europe, and has spent the last 12 years running a freelance  sales and marketing business.&nbsp; As owner of LCTours he designed  and&nbsp;coordinated&nbsp;tours to Scotland, Ireland, and Sweden.&nbsp; Lord  Ailsa had a great knack for finding little-known secrets to make every tour  special and unique. </p>
    <p>In 2011, Lord Ailsa was invited  to open the Hawaiian Scottish Festival in Hawaii. Sadly, he was involved in an  accident complications of which resulted in the amputation of the lower part of  his left leg, and his right toes. This did not slow him down; in fact, it made  him more determined to push his body to the limit.</p>
    <p>Early in 2014, Lord Ailsa was the  first paraplegic to snowmobile through the Swedish Arctic. He and his  colleagues completed 200 miles of the Arctic  snowmobile trip before finding themselves in the middle of a 150 mile an hour  hurricane, the biggest to hit Northern Sweden in 20 years, making the route  impassable.&nbsp; After being stuck for three days, the rescue service showed  them the way out, taking them under the strong winds.&nbsp; A few months  later, against the advice of several friends, Lord Ailsa did a seven line  canopy tour in the California redwoods over gullies and rivers, sometimes over  300 feet up.</p>
2014 also brought  Lord Ailsa the great Honor of becoming the first Chief of the Kennedy Honor  Guard, based in Titusville, Florida.&nbsp; This is the first Kennedy Honor  Guard in the States and the first in 250 years of Scotland&rsquo;s recorded history.
