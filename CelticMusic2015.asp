    <p><img src="images/ntif09-4-015-600.jpg" width="197" height="246" hspace="5" align="right" />Clandestine is hard-driving, toe-tapping Texas Celtic sound. Formed in  1991, the band is known for their brand of blasting tune sets and fresh songs.  Piper EJ Jones and fiddler Gregory McQueen lead the tunes with the full force  of their individual musical energies. Al Cofrin brings cittern and occasionally  another set of bagpipes to the mix. </p>
    <p>Percussionist and singer Emily Dugas  captivates with her original song collaborations with Al, as well as her  singular interpretations of songs in the Celtic genre. EJ and Al also join  Emily on vocals, with many songs now set in three-part harmony.</p>
    <p> Clandestine is a regular feature at the Texas Scottish Festival and the  North Texas Irish Festival, as well as their home pub, McGonigel’s Mucky Duck  in Houston. The band has toured the US extensively and had successful stints in  Canada and France. Now, Clandestine is poised to tour widely again.</p>

      <br />
      <img border="0" src="images/Rathkeltair.jpg" width="281" height="268" align="right" hspace="5" />Rathkeltair blends compelling and catchy original 
      songs with tight, driving straight-ahead 
      rock-n-roll, while never forgetting its Celtic 
      roots. <br />
      <br />
      Based in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, Rathkeltair 
      has been on the road full-time since 2003.&nbsp;Highly 
      regarded for its extraordinary energy, showmanship 
      and professionalism, Rathkeltair enjoys a loyal and 
      rapidly expanding community of friends and fans. <br />
      <br />
      Rathkeltair features three veteran road-warriors 
      from England, Northern Ireland and America.&nbsp;Noted 
      singer-songwriter/guitarist Trevor Tanner, former 
      front man for The Bolshoi, a mainstay of the UK club 
      scene at the height of the MTV era and the subject 
      of a rabid international underground cult following, 
      writes most of the band's original material.&nbsp;Drummer 
      Nick Watson (formerly of the Field Marshal 
      Montgomery Pipe Band) and 
      bagpiper/multi-instrumentalist Neil Anderson are two 
      of the original members of Clan Na Gael (7 Nations), 
      the NYC-based band that kicked off the &quot;kilt rock&quot; 
      phenomenon in the US in the mid-90's and inspired 
      many of the groups working in that genre today.<br />
      <br />
      Rathkeltair's name-sake is a famous historical site 
      in County Down, Northern Ireland, also known as the 
      &quot;mound of Down.&quot;&nbsp;Besides being close to the village 
      where Nick was born and raised, the band chose the 
      name as a tip of the hat to its Celtic heritage.</p>

    <p><b><font size="5">Seamus Kennedy</font></b></p>
    <p><img src="images/SKleapcelt-HIRES.jpg" width="250" height="224" hspace="5" align="right" />In his thirty years of professional performing, Seamus Kennedy has taken  his music from Alaska to Florida, Maryland to California and a host of stops in  between, playing everything from the pubs to the concert halls.&nbsp; As a  result, he is a master showman of exceptional musical skills and unmatched  repartee.</p>
    <p> Seamus’ trademark is his ongoing interaction with his audiences.&nbsp;  From the moment he steps on stage, he starts talking to them — and encourages  them to talk back!&nbsp; He is quick with a quip and likes nothing better than  to discover someone in the audience who is similarly inclined.&nbsp; Fast-paced  humor is very much a part of what Seamus does, whether he’s telling a series of  rapid-fire jokes or launching into a lyrical parody.</p>

  <br />
  <b><font size="5"><img border="0" src="images/jilc2.jpg" width="149" height="211" align="right" hspace="5" /></font></b>Originally from Montgomery, AL, Jil Chambless now 
  resides in Tuscaloosa and has played an active role 
  in the Celtic music scene for more than 20 years.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;As 
      singer and flute and whistle player, Jil has 
      completed many recording projects and performed at 
      Celtic festivals and concerts across the US as well 
      as in Canada, Scotland, and Israel with the band 
      Henri&#8217;s Notions, guitarist Scooter Muse, Scottish 
      singer Ed Miller, Scottish fiddler John Taylor, the 
      band Vulcan Eejits!, the Vogt Family Contra Band, 
      and others.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Jil brings to any audience a wonderful 
      listening experience from haunting ballads and 
      upbeat songs to toe-tapping tunes with a smooth 
      delivery that never fails to bring both smiles and 
      tears in every performance.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="5">Scooter Muse</font></b><br />
      <a href="http://www.scootermuse.com" target="_blank">www.scootermuse.com</a><br />
      <br />
      <img border="0" src="images/scooter2.jpg" width="359" height="249" align="right" hspace="5" />A long time guitar player, 1968 marked a big change 
      in the music Scooter Muse had digested during the 
      folk years. Bonnie and Clyde had a banjo on the 
      soundtrack &#8211; Earl Scruggs&#8217; Foggy Mt. Breakdown &#8211; and 
      from that point on he never looked back.<br />
      <br />
      Finally, after the summer of 1972, with the sound of 
      Dueling Banjos on any folkie&#8217;s mind, Scooter 
      purchased his first banjo, took a few lessons &#8211; and 
      almost 40 years later has been fortunate to win 
      countless banjo competitions throughout the 
      southeast including the Tennessee Valley 
      Championships 8 times.<br />
      <br />
      He has played banjo with bluegrass legends, Claire 
      Lynch, Vassar Clements and a host of others as well 
      as handling first call banjo duties for the world 
      famous Muscle Shoals, Alabama recording industry.<br />
      <br />
      While at the Briarfield Bluegrass Festival in 
      Alabama in the early 80&#8217;s, another life-changer for 
      him was experiencing the progressive Celtic sounds 
      of a great band, Touchstone.&nbsp;That show launched him 
      into the world of Celtic music on banjo, and 
      ultimately, moving into the world of open tunings on 
      the guitar.<br />
      In the 90&#8217;s he founded the Full Moon Ensemble, who 
      achieved national recognition, toured the US and 
      Canada as well as Scotland and recorded 5 critically 
      acclaimed CDs. After a successful 8 year run, the 
      FME went their separate ways and Scooter was drafted 
      as the guitar player for the longest running Celtic 
      band in the south, Henri&#8217;s Notions, based in 
      Tuscaloosa, AL for over 30 years.&nbsp;The Notions 
      consistently play festivals, concerts and other 
      venues throughout the southeast and have appeared 
      with such great artists as Bob Dylan, Paddy Obrien, 
      Patrick Street, Brian McNeill and countless others.<br />
      <br />
      In 2005, Scooter recorded his first solo guitar CD, 
      Saddell Abbey, with all original material as well as 
      original music set to the poetry of Robert Burns.</p>
